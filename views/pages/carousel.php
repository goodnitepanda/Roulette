it will be some text in a box that shows your current position will always be at 1 on button click.
 then you use the itemamt variable which will have to be scoped globaly instead of insde of the imagecontainer click function
  and do the same for currentindex. cosume those values and on click on the button or imagecontainer
   for now this will get updated  -->

<div class ='imagecontainer'>
